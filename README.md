This project's goal is to be able to create a 3D single-player RPG in the Mossflower world, based on Unity 3D & C#.

Currently, the game is being designed conceptually.

Next steps will be:

-Creating the game art (textures, tiles etc.)
-Creating animations
-Designing level maps
-Designing locations
-Designing quests and the GUI
-Programming the game
-Designing levels
-Publishing
